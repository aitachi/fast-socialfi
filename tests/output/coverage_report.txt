Warning: This is a nightly build of Foundry. It is recommended to use the latest stable version. To mute this warning set `FOUNDRY_DISABLE_NIGHTLY_WARNING` in your environment. 

Warning: optimizer settings and `viaIR` have been disabled for accurate coverage reports.
If you encounter "stack too deep" errors, consider using `--ir-minimum` which enables `viaIR` with minimum optimization resolving most of the errors
